# Acknowledgments

> This work is a quiet acknowledgment of the thousands of individual insights that have shaped this field. The TeeZe Prompting System (TPS) stands on the shoulders of the very community it seeks to serve.

## Foundations

The design and philosophy of TPS are built upon the pioneering work of many.

#### Ethical Guardrails
The core of our Ethical Monitoring Function (EMF) is deeply influenced by decades of work in applied ethics and AI safety. We specifically acknowledge:
*   The public AI principles pioneered at **[Google](https://ai.google/responsibility/principles/)**.
*   The foundational research in **[Constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution)** at **Anthropic**.
*   The philosophical vision of **human-computer symbiosis**, first dreamt by the early pioneers of computing, which remains the guiding star of our work.

#### Technical Orchestration
The TPS Framework is made possible by the immense investment of model providers and the brilliance of the open-source community. We acknowledge:
*   The creators of the **Transformer architecture** that underpins all modern LLMs.
*   The developers of powerful open models, such as **[Llama](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)** and **[Mistral](https://mistral.ai/)**.
*   The essential platforms like **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)** and **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** that make this technology accessible to everyone.

## A Note on Synthesis and Collaboration

The ingenuity of prompt engineers has been a process of remarkable discovery. Each new technique—from Chain-of-Thought to persona prompting and tiered frameworks—was a brilliant landmark found by a pioneer in an uncharted territory.

TPS is designed not as a replacement for these discoveries, but as a **navigational chart**. It is a comprehensive methodology that organizes these individual landmarks into a coherent, ethically-grounded map.

We offer this system to the community as a tool to formalize inspiration and journey toward more consistent, intentional, and responsible outcomes.
