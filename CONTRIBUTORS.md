## How Can I Contribute?

At this early stage, the most valuable contributions are feedback, bug reports, and discussions about new ideas. The best way to start is by opening an issue or discussion on GitHub.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs

If you find a typo, a confusing sentence, an error in a template, or any other issue, please **[open a new issue](https://github.com/teeze-solutions/TPS/issues/new)**. Describe the problem clearly and, if possible, suggest a fix.

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new template, a change to the methodology, or any other enhancement, please **[open a new issue](https://github.com/teeze-solutions/TPS/issues/new)** to start a discussion. We'd love to hear your thoughts before any work begins.

### üó£Ô∏è Sharing Use Cases

## Submitting Pull Requests

While we appreciate the desire to contribute directly, it's important to keep the project's vision coherent. To respect your time and ours, we have a clear policy:

**Please open an issue to discuss any proposed changes *before* starting work on a pull request.**

This ensures that all parties are aligned on the direction and prevents you from spending time on work that might not be merged.

The process is as follows:
1.  Open an issue and discuss the proposed change with the maintainers.
2.  Once agreed, fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3.  Make your changes.
4.  Submit a pull request, linking it back to the original issue.
