# The TPS Toolkit: Ready-to-Use Prompts and Templates

This toolkit is the "machine side" of the shared vocabulary. It contains the copy-paste-ready templates that put the **TPS Methodology** into practice.

These prompts are designed to give the AI clear, structured instructions that align with its training, making your results more predictable and useful.

---

## How to Use These Tools

You can use the TPS Toolkit in two primary ways:

1.  **For Quick Tasks (Ad-Hoc):** Simply copy a **Tier 1, 2, or 3** template below and fill it out for a single, specific request. This is great for one-off tasks.

2.  **For Full Sessions (Recommended):** Start your conversation by loading the **Master System Prompt**. This makes the AI "TPS-aware," instructing it on the different tiers and the ethical guardrails. After that, you can use the Tier templates in your conversation with an AI that fully understands the framework.

## The Tier Templates

Choose a template based on the communication style you selected from the Methodology.

### üî® Tier 1: The Simple Request
Use this for quick, direct tasks.

**Template:**
<pre>
Instruction: [What you want the AI to do]
Context: [Optional: Background information the AI needs]
Constraints: [Optional: Rules the AI must follow, like word count or format]
</pre>

**Example:**
<pre>
Instruction: Write a subject line for an email.
Context: The email is a weekly newsletter for a local book club.
Constraints: The subject line must be under 10 words and include a book-related pun.
</pre>

### üìê Tier 2: The Blueprint
Use this for structured, multi-step projects.

**Template:**
<pre>
Task Definition: [The overall goal of the project]
Role Assignment: [Who the AI should act as (e.g., "an expert project manager")]
Process Steps:
    1. [First step]
    2. [Second step]
    3. [etc...]
Output Format: [How the final result should be structured (e.g., "a markdown document with headings")]
Constraints: [Overall rules for the project]
</pre>

**Example:**
<pre>
Task Definition: Create a 3-day workout plan for a beginner.
Role Assignment: Act as a certified personal trainer.
Process Steps:
    1. Define the goal for each of the 3 days (e.g., Day 1: Full Body, Day 2: Cardio).
    2. For each day, list 5 exercises with a brief description.
    3. Add a "Warm-Up" and "Cool-Down" section.
Output Format: A simple, easy-to-read list for each day.
Constraints: Do not include exercises that require specialized gym equipment.
</pre>

### üß† Tier 3: The Brainstorming Session
Use this to start an open-ended, creative conversation.

**Template:**
<pre>
Role Assignment: [Who the AI should be as a creative partner (e.g., "a skeptical futurist," "an optimistic brand strategist")]
Exploration Objective: [The core problem or idea you want to explore]
Context: [What you already know or the starting situation]
Interaction Style: [How you want to collaborate (e.g., "Let's debate the pros and cons," "Ask me clarifying questions before offering ideas")]
</pre>

**Example:**
<pre>
Role Assignment: Act as a venture capitalist who has seen thousands of startup pitches. Be critical but fair.
Exploration Objective: Is a subscription service for house plants a viable business?
Context: I've noticed a trend in subscription boxes and a separate trend in indoor plant ownership. I want to see if they can be merged.
Interaction Style: Poke holes in my idea. Tell me what could go wrong. Let's identify the fatal flaws together.
</pre>
