# The TPS Methodology: A Human Guide to Clearer AI Communication

The biggest challenge in working with AI is translating our intent into a language the AI can understand. The TPS Methodology is a simple mental framework designed to solve this.

It's based on one idea: **match your communication style to your task's complexity.**

This methodology gives you three basic communication styles, or "Tiers," to choose from.

## Three Ways to Talk to an AI

### 🔨 Tier 1: The Simple Request
*   **What it is:** A direct, one-shot instruction for simple tasks.
*   **Example Tasks:** "Summarize this email," "Translate this sentence."

### 📐 Tier 2: The Blueprint
*   **What it is:** A structured plan for complex projects with multiple parts.
*   **Example Tasks:** "Create a project plan for a new podcast," "Write a detailed blog post."

### 🧠 Tier 3: The Brainstorming Session
*   **What it is:** An open-ended, collaborative conversation to explore ideas.
*   **Example Tasks:** "Help me figure out a new business idea," "Explore the ethical implications of a new technology."

## The Built-in "Moral Compass"

Effective communication is about more than just clarity; it's about responsibility. The TeeZe Prompting System is designed with a built-in **Ethical Monitoring Function (EMF)**. This foundational layer ensures the conversation remains helpful, harmless, and fair, and is automatically activated when using the **TPS Toolkit**.

## Next Steps

By choosing a "Tier," you clarify your intent and set yourself up for better results.
