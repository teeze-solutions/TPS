# The TPS Methodology: A Human Guide to Clearer AI Communication

The biggest challenge in working with AI isn't the AI's power; it's translating our intent into a language the AI can understand without confusion. The TPS Methodology is a simple mental framework to help you do just that.

It's based on one idea: **match your communication style to your task's complexity.**

This methodology gives you three basic communication styles, or "Tiers," to choose from.

## The Three Tiers of Communication

### 🔨 Tier 1: The Simple Request
*   **What it is:** A direct, one-shot instruction for simple, everyday tasks.
*   **Analogy:** Using a **hammer** to hit a single nail.

### 📐 Tier 2: The Blueprint
*   **What it is:** A structured plan for complex projects with multiple parts.
*   **Analogy:** Using a **blueprint** to build a house.

### 🧠 Tier 3: The Brainstorming Session
*   **What it is:** An open-ended, collaborative conversation to explore ideas.
*   **Analogy:** Working on a **whiteboard** with a creative partner.

## How to Choose the Right Tier: A Quick Guide

Not sure which Tier to use? Ask yourself these three questions:

1.  **Do I know exactly what the final output should look like?**
    *   **Yes, and it's a single, simple thing:** Use **Tier 1 (Simple Request)**.
    *   **Yes, but it has multiple parts or steps:** Use **Tier 2 (Blueprint)**.
    *   **No, I'm not sure what the answer is:** Use **Tier 3 (Brainstorming Session)**.

2.  **What is my goal?**
    *   **To get a quick answer or perform a direct action:** Use **Tier 1**. (e.g., "Translate this.")
    *   **To build a complete asset or project:** Use **Tier 2**. (e.g., "Create a project plan.")
    *   **To explore an idea or solve a fuzzy problem:** Use **Tier 3**. (e.g., "Help me invent a new business idea.")

3.  **What is my relationship with the AI?**
    *   **It's a tool:** Use **Tier 1**.
    *   **It's a skilled contractor:** Use **Tier 2**.
    *   **It's a creative partner:** Use **Tier 3**.

Choosing a Tier is simply about clarifying your own intent before you begin.

## The Built-in "Moral Compass"

Effective communication is about more than just clarity; it's about responsibility. The TeeZe Prompting System is designed with a built-in **Ethical Monitoring Function (EMF)**. This foundational layer ensures the conversation remains helpful, harmless, and fair and is automatically activated when you use the **TPS Toolkit**.

## Ready for the Next Step?

Now that you know how to structure your thoughts, you can use the TPS Toolkit to get the right template for the job.
